# Printf function implementation

## Brief

The purpose of the project is to stimulate similiar functionalities of the function `printf` from the standard library `<stdio.h>`;

## Motivation
TODO
There are mandatory and bonus parts. Of which, mandatory part is designed for students to build the minimal printf. In that sense, we only aim to build a function that can print the specifier `cduisxX%`, whereas the bonus is little complex.In the bonus part, it is necessary to understand the positional framework and consider all possible combination. That is, you have to read the documentation in details. Lots of people at my campus just did the mandatory part and moved on the next project. However, I decided to challenge myself for doing the bonus part.To be honest, in the subject, it mentions that "You don't need to do all the bonus." It is true that sometimes learn how to give up and when to give up is an important skill.
