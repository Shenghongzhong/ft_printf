# Printf function implementation

## Brief

The purpose of the project is to stimulate similiar functionalities of the function `printf` from the standard library `<stdio.h>`;

## Motivation
There are mandatory and bonus parts. Of which, the mandatory part is designed for students to build the minimal printf. 
In that sense, we only aim to build a function that can print the specifier `cduispxX%`, whereas the bonus is little complex.
In the bonus part, it is necessary to understand the positional framework and consider all possible combination. 
That is, you have to read the documentation in details. 

Lots of people at my campus just did the mandatory part and moved on the next project. 
However, I decided to challenge myself for doing the bonus part.
Not because I am brilliant but I just wanted to do it. 
Yet, to be honest, it mentions in subject that "You don't need to do all the bonus." 
It is wise to skip and it is true that sometimes learn how to give up and when to give up is an important skill. 

## What I learned

1. Makefile is actually a recipe

Initially, I learned that Makefile was an alien concept and I was reading every single words in makefiletutorial.com, 
and the result was that I still knew nothing about it when doing my first project libft. 
As for the second project Get_Next_LINE project, I just used the similar structure of the libft. 
However, this time I spent an extra time to understand what I needed to do for the makefile. 
I accidently discovered the secret of writing code. It actually blew my mind but I will put it on the second point. 

Writing Makefile is easy. Prior to that, the basics of Makefile are important to know first. 
For example what is target, and what is the dependency. 
and what are `$<` and `$@`? Then the juicy part is that you need to know what you are doing. 
Even if you don't know what you are doing, you have to design with the mind that you know what you need the computer to achieve. 
Code is just the post-thought or a process of write-and-think.
